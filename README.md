## Description

It consists of 10 projects made with C# language and Windows Forms and includes UML diagrams created with Astah software. Although WinForms are currently legacy, the code is still useful for learning OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) principles and C# commands and syntax.

Now I am working on internationalization, standardization, refactoring, bug fixes, code cleaning and implementation of new features in the solution.

## Installation

No need to install. The projects in solution are all independent and small Windows programs.
